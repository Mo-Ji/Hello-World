# Hello-World
This is my first contact with Git-Hub and it seems that it's not bad, actually, I feel so good.
I am a new in college, and my major is automation, and I hope to enter the artificial intelligence industry in the future.
Though I have only learned a little C-programming and Python, I dream of becoming a great programmer.
I hope my trip here can give me much that I can't learn in my college.Thanks.(And I'm from China.#^.^#)
